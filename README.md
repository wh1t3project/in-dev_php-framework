in-dev_php-framework
==================

Pure PHP framework (BETA)

NOTE: No name for now and this README is raw 

This is a highly customizable PHP framework that can be improved by using modules
Modules can be be downloaded from third-party website or by yourself.
See our guides and tutorials for creating a module, this is easy!

The framework work as a set of library written in pure PHP all linked together using 
a kernel. This allow developers to create their own modules and content using pure PHP 
without referring to functions.
However, we recommend using functions defined by the themes when creating pages in webroot
to allow universal content management (no need to modify any code when changing the theme).
